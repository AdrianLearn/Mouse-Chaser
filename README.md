  - Enemies (follow the player at randomly generated speeds)
  - Health bar (starts at 100% and decreases on collision of player and skeleton enemy)
  - Current score

Game Controls:
  - Mouse movement controls player sprite's movement
  - Mouse click:
    - Restarts game if the game was over (health bar at 0)
  - Double mouse click:
    - Deploys a scarecrow (enemies chase after scarecrow instead of player for 5 seconds)
